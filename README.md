## What are at least 2 technical issues you encountered with your project? How did you fix them?
### I could not get the html to show the result of the function, I could only get it to show the "object at function ..." so instead I just simplified my getMovie class and just had variables instead of defined objects
### Pulling the image from the api path was extremely difficult, I used html image formatting to finally get it to work
## What are at least 2 known problems (still existing), if any, with your project? (If none, what are two things you would improve about your project if given more time?)
### I would add stylization with CSS, my HTML is pretty barebones
### I would make my code more organized and have it work more efficiently, the load time is anywhere from 2-3 seconds everytime for a simple html.
